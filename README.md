## Getting Started on Development

You will need the following tools installed beforehand:

- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

```sh
brew install carthage swiftlint yarn
gem install cocoapods
```

Then you can setup the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:instructure/canvas-ios.git
cd canvas-ios
./setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` script should take care of installing additional dependencies from Carthage, Cocoapods, and yarn.

### Carthage

Carthage is used to checkout the source code of the EarlGrey 2 dependency.
EG2 is included via source because Carthage doesn't support building static libraries.

PSPDFKit is also installed via Carthage.

- `carthage update` Updates `Cartfile.resolved` with new dependencies
- `carthage bootstrap` Fetches dependencies defined in `Cartfile.resolved`

### Secrets

Any static keys, tokens, passwords, or other secrets that need to be available in the app bundle should be added as a case to `Secret.swift`.

The secrets necessary for a particular build are generated as data assets using a script.

```sh
yarn secrets "studentPSPDFKitLicense=token1" "teacherPSPDFKitLicense=token2"
```

You will need to purchase PSPDFKitLicenses to distribute custom apps. Instructure's licenses are only used for official builds and are not included in the repository.

### Firebase Analytics

If you wish to use Firebase Analytics in custom apps, you will need to populate the `GoogleService-Info.plist` for each app.


## Contributing Guiding Principles

### Simple

Writing an app is complex. Decisions made from the beginning have a big impact on the end result.

We strive to maintain a simple architecture that is easy to understand and pick up. Someone familiar with the platform should be productive within a single day.

Code should be self-documenting and easy to follow.

```
Ugly code is easy to recognize and its cost is easy to estimate. Neither is true for a wrong abstraction.
- Dan Abramov
```

### Easy to Debug

Surprise! Apps have bugs. Industry average is 15-50 defects per 1000 lines of code.

We build our apps in a way that makes finding and fixing issues is as easy as possible.

### Testable

Writing code in a testable way is paramount for long term success. These apps are built in a way that makes our unit testing surface as large as possible.

### Conventions

We make and keep strong [conventions](./CONVENTIONS.md) in order to reduce mental overhead.

### No Tricky Stuff

We do things the Apple prescribed way because it offers the best long term predictability with minimal maintenance.

### Fat Model, Thin Controller

Models & Presenters handle as much of the business logic as possible. This allows a wide unit testing surface. Views & View Controllers should be as small as possible.

### Predictable

By scrutinizing each dependency we bring in, the code we write is our responsibility. Unit tests are a key portion of the code we write, so as time passes, the code that worked 2 years ago still works today.

### Automation

We don't do any manual QA of our products. We write code that tests our apps for us.

### Prune Legacy Code

ðŸ˜¬ One day React Native, Cocoapods, CanvasKit and other old frameworks will be fully replaced by the swift architecture (Core + StudentReborn). Eventually. Hopefully. ðŸ¤ž


## Using the Canvas Apps

### How to connect to a local canvas instance
- Modify the contents of preload-account-info.plist (it's at the root of the repo)
  * See How To Generate a Developer Key section below
  * `client_id` is the `ID` of a generated Developer Key
  * `client_secret` is the `Key` of the generated Developer Key
- Build and run the app locally
- On the login page, your local canvas instance will appear in the top left corner of the screen

### How to Generate a Developer Key
- Visit `web.canvas.docker/accounts/self/developer_keys` (replace `web.canvas.docker`
with your local instance
- Click `+ Developer Key`
- Give it a name and the following fields:
  * `Redirect URI (Legacy)`: `https://canvas/login`
  * `Redirect URIs` (separated by new lines):
    - https://canvas/login
    - canvas-courses://canvas/login
    - canvas-teacher://canvas/login
    - canvas-parent://canvas/login

### Generating icons from [instructure.design](https://instructure.design/#iconography)

Most, if not all of the icons used in the Canvas apps can be found in instructure-icons, but are defined as React components, SVG, & Sketch files. Since iOS does not handle SVG files in UIImageViews natively, these are converted to PDF.

```sh
yarn build-icons
```

### Generating code coverage report

You can generate code coverage reports with `yarn coverage --scheme <SCHEME>`

#### Student
```bash
yarn coverage --scheme Student
```

#### Core
```bash
yarn coverage --scheme Core
```

To run tests first use `yarn test`
```bash
yarn test --scheme Core
```

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| scheme  | The scheme to run against  |
| os  | Specify simulator os. Only available when running tests  |


## Open Source Licenses Used

We have a script that should ensure the correct license header comments are in place:

```sh
yarn update-headers
```
