 * Simple middleware heavily based of off redux-promise for handling FSA
 * promises:
 *
 *   - When a FSA action is received with a payload that is a promise, or with
 *     a payload with a `promise` member, the action is tagged with a
 *     `pending: true` field.
 *   - When the attached promise resolves, a copy of the action is re-dispatched
 *     with its `payload` set to the promised value.
 *   - When the attached promise rejects, a copy of the action is re-dispatched
 *     with its `payload` set to the error, and the `error: true` tag.
