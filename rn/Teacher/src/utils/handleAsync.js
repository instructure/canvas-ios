 * Defines an action handler specifically geared for FSA async actions generated
 * by promiseMiddleware. Handlers is a dictionary with three optional values:
 *
 *  - pending: reducer that is run when the promise is first created
 *  - resolved: reducer that is called when the promise is resolved with the
 *    promised value.
 *  - rejected: reducer that is called when the promise is rejected with the
 *    thrown error.
