        In this lesson, we'll focus on the importance of regular security
        assessments and the role they play in maintaining strong security
        practices. You'll learn how to identify and report improper practices,
        even subtle ones that don’t align with security standards, and the value
        of continuous education to stay ahead of emerging threats. Engaging in
        ongoing training and using company-provided tools will help reinforce a
        culture of vigilance and proactive security.In this lesson, we'll focus
