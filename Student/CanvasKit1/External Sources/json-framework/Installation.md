JSON Framework Installation
===========================

The simplest way to start using the JSON Framework in your iPhone, iPad, or Mac application is to import the source into your application. 

1. Drag the JSON folder from the distribution.
1. Drop it on the **Classes** group in the **Groups & Files** menu of your Xcode project.
1. Tick the **Copy items into destination group's folder** option.
1. Use `#import "JSON.h"` in  your source files.

Upgrading
---------

If you're upgrading from a previous version, make sure you're deleting the old JSON group first, moving all the files to Trash.
